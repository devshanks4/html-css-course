<P>Posted by Laura Jones on Monday, June 21st 2027</P>
<P> All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</P>
<p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language)</p>
<p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
